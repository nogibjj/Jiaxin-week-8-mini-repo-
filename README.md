This is a description of a weather forecast module for Polybar that requires the Weather Icons and Material Icons fonts to work properly. 

## Create a weather forecast module for Polybar
Here are the steps to use this module:

1. Install the Weather Icons and Material Icons fonts: You need to download and install the Weather Icons and Material Icons fonts in your system. These fonts are usually available in the official package repositories of most Linux distributions. Alternatively, you can download the fonts from the official websites and install them manually.

2. Write a script to fetch weather data: Write a script that fetches weather data from a weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap or Weather Underground. The script should parse the data and extract the information you need, such as current temperature and forecast data.

3. Write a script to format the output: Once you have the weather data, you need to format it for display in Polybar. You can use a scripting language such as Python or Bash to format the output. The output should contain the current temperature and the 3-hour forecast, along with the appropriate weather icons from the Weather Icons font.

4. Configure the Polybar module: Finally, you need to configure the Polybar module to use the weather script you created. You can do this by adding a new module to your Polybar configuration file, specifying the script and the output format.

Here's an example of what the Polybar configuration file might look like:
```
[module/weather]
type = custom/script
exec = /path/to/weather_script.sh
interval = 600
format = <label>
label-font = 2

[bar/top]
modules-left = weather
```
Replace "/path/to/weather_script.sh" with the actual path to the weather script you created. The "interval" option sets the update interval to 600 seconds (10 minutes). The "format" option specifies the output format using Handlebars syntax. Replace "<label>" with the actual label you want to display, which should contain the formatted weather data. The "label-font" option sets the font index for the label to 2, which corresponds to the Weather Icons font.

Finally, the "modules-left" option specifies the modules that should be displayed on the left side of the Polybar. In this example, only the "weather" module is displayed.

## An example TOML configuration file
```
# Register at https://openweathermap.org to get your API key
# If you don't want to write your key here, you can delete this line and use the OWM_API_KEY environment variable instead
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# This is for Montreal, find your city at https://openweathermap.org
# The id will be the last part of the URL
city_id = "6077243"

# Output format, using Handlebars syntax, meaning variables should be used like {{ this }}
# Available tokens are:
# - temp_celcius
# - temp_kelvin
# - temp_fahrenheit
# - temp_icon
# - trend
# - forecast_celcius
# - forecast_kelvin
# - forecast_fahrenheit
# - forecast_icon
display = "{{ temp_icon }} {{ temp_celcius }}°C {{ trend }} {{ forecast_icon }} {{ forecast_celcius }}°C"
```

Above is a Python script for fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and formatting the output for display in Polybar. Here are the steps to use this script:

1. Sign up for an OpenWeatherMap API key: You need to create an account on the OpenWeatherMap website and obtain an API key. This key will be used to authenticate your requests to the API.

2. Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key: In the first line of the script, replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with the API key you obtained in step 1. Alternatively, you can set the OWM_API_KEY environment variable to your API key, and the script will automatically pick it up.

3. Set your city ID: In the second line of the script, replace "6077243" with the ID of your city. You can find your city ID by searching for your city on the OpenWeatherMap website and looking at the URL.

4. Customize the output format: In the third line of the script, you can customize the output format to your liking using Handlebars syntax. The available tokens are listed in the comment.

5. Run the script: Save the script to a file with a ".py" extension, and run it using the Python interpreter. The script should output the weather data in the format specified in the "display" variable.

6. Integrate the script with Polybar: Finally, you need to integrate the script with Polybar. You can do this by adding a new module to your Polybar configuration file, specifying the path to the script and the output format. For example:
```
[module/weather]
type = custom/script
exec = python /path/to/weather_script.py
interval = 300
format = <label>
```
Replace "/path/to/weather_script.py" with the actual path to the script, and "<label>" with the Handlebars syntax for the label you want to display.
